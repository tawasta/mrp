Auto-process Work Orders in two steps
=====================================

This is a modified version of module mrp_production_autoprocess_work_orders.
Work orders are created and marked as done with two different functions. This
allows a cancellation of a manufacturing order after the first button has been
pressed. Cancelling a manufacturing order also now would cancel all its related
work orders.
